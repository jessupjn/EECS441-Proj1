DESCRIPTION:
A collaborative typing app built in EECS 441 using a collaboration client given to us by Professor Elliot Soloway. It is built to be similar to Google docs and allows users to create and join sessions to type together. An undo and redo feature is also implemented. It was built as iOS 7 was released and was meant to model the very clean, simple layout that iOS 7 implements.
